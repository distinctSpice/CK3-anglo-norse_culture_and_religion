This mods add a new Englisc culture and a new Bretlandic Asatru religion. The decision to convert to Englisc culture may only be activated once you have created the Kingdom of Danelaw or the Kingdom of Daneland. Both the culture and the religion is available in the Ruler Designer. Not save game compatible.

This mod's purpose is quite personal, so it is tailored to my needs. For example, the Bretlandic Asatru's doctrine and tenets were almost the same with Asatru besides the equal gender religious law and the monogamous marriage type. Furthermore, all of the holy sites is only located near the British Isles. The religion part is not available in the initial steam mod and is entirely created by me.
